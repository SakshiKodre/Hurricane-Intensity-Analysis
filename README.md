# Hurricane Intensity and Atmospheric Pressure Analysis
## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between atmospheric pressure and hurricane intensity. The research explores how lower central pressure influences wind speed and hurricane strength using statistical modeling and data science techniques.

## Research Hypothesis
Lower central pressure in hurricanes correlates with higher wind speeds and stronger Saffir-Simpson categories.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes hurricane datasets containing:

Category (Saffir-Simpson scale)

Central Pressure

Wind Speed

Latitude & Longitude

Temporal Data

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing hurricane data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Scatter plots, trend analysis

Statistical Analysis: Correlation analysis between pressure and wind speed

Predictive Modeling: Implementing Bayesian Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression

Visualization: Graphical representation of key insights

## Key Findings
Strong negative correlation found between pressure and wind speed

High wind speeds predominantly occur in low-pressure regions

Bayesian and multiple regression models help quantify this relationship

## Models Used
Bayesian Linear Regression: For analyzing pressure-wind speed relationship

Multiple/Simple Linear Regression: For statistical modeling of trends

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations:

Correlation heatmaps

Scatter plots of pressure vs. wind speed

Trend analysis across hurricane categories

## Requirements
Python libraries used:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scipy

scikit-learn

statsmodels

## How to Run
Clone the repository

Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter notebooks in sequence

## Future Work
Improve predictive modeling for hurricane intensity

Incorporate additional meteorological factors

Expand analysis to regional hurricane patterns
